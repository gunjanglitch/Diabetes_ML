# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning  

This project predicts whether a person has diabetes using **Machine Learning** techniques.  
We trained and evaluated an **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** model on the **PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset**.

## 📊 Dataset  

- **Source**: [PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)  
- **Features**:  
  - Pregnancies  
  - Glucose Level  
  - Blood Pressure  
  - Skin Thickness  
  - Insulin Level  
  - BMI  
  - Diabetes Pedigree Function  
  - Age  
- **Target**:  
  - `0` → Non-diabetic  
  - `1` → Diabetic

## ⚙️ Project Workflow  

1. Import required libraries (`NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Scikit-learn`)  
2. Load and explore dataset  
3. Preprocess data  
   - Standardize features using `StandardScaler`  
   - Split into training & testing sets  
4. Train ML model  
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier  
5. Evaluate model performance  
   - Accuracy score on training and testing sets

## 📈 Results  

- The SVM model achieved **good accuracy** in predicting diabetes.  
- Performance may vary slightly depending on dataset split.
